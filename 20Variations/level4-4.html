    For I have seen Love 
    And his face is choice of Heart of Hearts, 
    A flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center 
    Where all Motion are One 

    And I have known 
    Despair that the Face has ceased to stare
    At me with the Rose of the World 
    But lies furled 

    In an artificial Paradise 
    It is Hell to get into. If I knew you were there 
    I would fall upon my knees 
    And plead to God 

    To deliver you once again in my arms
    But it is senseless to try.
    One can only take means to reduce misery,
    Confuse the sensations 

    So that this face, 
    What aches in the heart and makes each  new start. 
    Less close to the source of desire

    Fade- from the flesh that fired the Night 
    With dreams and unutterable longing </div>
