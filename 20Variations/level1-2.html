	<br> <p> Cocaine </p></br>
        <br> For I have seen Love </br>
        <br> And his face is choice of Heart of Hearts,</br>
        <br>A flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center </br>
        <br>Where all Motion are One </br>

        <br>And I have known </br>
        <br>Despair that the Face has ceased to stare</br>
        <br>At me with the Rose of the World </br>
        <br>But lies furled </br>

        <br>In an artificial Paradise </br>
        <br>It is Hell to get into. If I knew you were there </br>
        <br>I would fall upon my knees </br>
        <br>And plead to God </br>

        <br>To deliver you once again in my arms</br>
        <br>But it is senseless to try.</br>
        <br>One can only take means to reduce misery,</br>
        <br>Confuse the sensations </br>

        <br>So that this face, </br>
        <br>What aches in the heart and makes each  new start.</br>
        <br>Less close to the source of desire</br>

        <br>Fade- from the flesh that fired the Night</br> 
        <br>With dreams and unutterable longing</br> 
        <br>7.14-15.62</br>
