	Trader Joe's is more than just a grocery store for me. It is a place where people gather to do one single action: cook. Whether it is for themselves or for someone else. Cooking is an act of love, self-care, respect and appreciation

<a href="https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/riches"> Riches</a> 
by Jeanne D.Rhein</span> <br>
They say that times were tough then<br>
That money was very tight<br>
But I remember my childhood<br>
And I know that can't be right<br><br>

Mom would cook our dinner<br>
Dad came home at five<br>
We were all sitting at the table<br>
Waiting for him to arrive<br><br>

We wouldn't eat from a microwave<br>
Or a restaurant down the street<br>
We all ate Mom's home cooking<br>
And boy that can't be beat<br><br>

We didn't eat in front of the TV<br>
Or with a phone in our hand<br>
We weren't plugged into a stereo<br>
bopping to the latest band<br><br>

We would all sit at the table<br>
Everyone in their place<br>
There were never any surprises<br>
We recognized every face<br><br>

Brothers to the left of me<br>
Sisters to the right<br>
That's the way we ate dinner<br>
Every single night<br><br>

We laughed we joked we talked we ate<br>
We were a family don't you see<br>
Though some may have been raised poor<br>
You can see it wasn't me<br><br>

We ate collards we ate biscuits<br>
We ate fatback and black-eyed peas<br>
We said yes sir we said no sir<br>
We said thank you ma'am and please<br><br>

So when you talk of family life<br>
Or how it used to be<br>
Though many had more money<br>
None were as rich as me<br><br>
