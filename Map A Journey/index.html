	<p>Monday morning 7:30am, I wake up earlier than Trader Joe’s opening time so that I can get to the market as soon as possible. My go-to Trader’s Joe’s is located on 675 6th Avenue near the Chelsea area. This Trader Joe’s I is surrounded by a variety of stores like Staples, Bed & Bath, Marshalls, and the Container Store. It is also surrounded by many restaurants and other shops. I think that the location of this Trader Joe’s is popular due to the surrounding apartments, and companies. There is a mta less for those coming from locations far from a Trader’s Joe. Trader’s Joes is important to me because when I was a freshmen coming to Parsons my sister who graduated from NYU told me to go to Trader’s Joe whenever I needed groceries. It was one of the first places I visited when I started school. I remember buying my first bag of groceries and coming home excited to see what groceries in New York were like. I was so used to Hong Kong franchise markets I was extremely excited about the different foods offered in American markets. This year, I have been trying to budget and try to cook more at home since my dorm offers a kitchen. I think that Trader Joe’s is a special place for me because it offers so many different options for a reasonable price. It is not overly expensive but not too cheap that it seems unofficial. As a college student living in New York City, an average high quality meal (that are not fast foods) can cost anywhere between $9-20. I have also tried to live a healthier low budget lifestyle and therefore I try to search for cheaper alternatives for expensive foods. I think that Trader Joes offers the best produce in my budget range. </p>
	<div class="p">On my way to Trader Joes I always go through the same route. This route is particularly interesting because it is surrounded by hair salons, apartments, fitness gyms and tech shops. I think that living around the Chelsea area, residents here are usually busy working adults,families with young children and elderly citizens. For this reason I think that having a Trader Joe’s nearby is convenient. Every morning, the Chelsea area is busy with people trying to get to their jobs. I think in every ten people, eight people always carry coffee. On my way to Trader Joes there is a coffee shop that I have recently started to appreciate called, Grumpy Cafe. Right next to the coffee shop is a senior citizens home, police station and a Chelsea International Hotel. I think that my morning route to my grocery shopping is also met with a lot of people from different cultures and backgrounds as well. Every morning I am also met with many other people with grocery bags. Because Trader’s Joes opens early in the morning it is easy for people to do some early grocery shopping before heading off to work. On my way I am always met with different scents of coffee, dog urine and feces, the smell of lavender from the senior citizens home and salon chemical smells. I think that the area embodies what foreigners think New York would smell like.
