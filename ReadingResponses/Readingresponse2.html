	<h2> Which era of interface web design do you find most influential or appealing? Why?  </h2>
	
    	<p> I think that the most appealing interface was in the 90's due to its beginning designs of the web. I think that during the time design was minimalistic and straightforward. Unlike the design now, which is much more complex and has many more layers than it did before. I believe that even though time has progressed and technology advanced immensely, like Oliana stated much like old fashion trends, web design trends from the past have come back. Retro, and pop art that was widely used back in the 90s have become a new trend now. Which is why I believe the 90s is most influential!
