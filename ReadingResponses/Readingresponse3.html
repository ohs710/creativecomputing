<h1> The article states that protest art can be kind of goofy. How does Banksy work in a way where his art is powerful and passionate, without being corny at all?</h1>
 
<p>Banksy’s graffiti is powerful because it sends the message without any other explanation. His art does not require paragraphs of text explaining why he chose to make the graffiti. The message is loud and clear through his use of colors, characters and play on words. It is not corny because his artworks evoke emotion, thought and it makes the viewers reflect. Like the article mentioned, “actions do speak louder than words”. In Banksy’s case, his act of placing his graffiti’s in areas where people would become affected is not only smart but strategic. His art is carefully created to follow the current social, political and economic issues which makes his works updated. Recently his artwork was in the Sotheby’s auction. In preparation for the auction Banksy had pre-made a paper shredder inside the frame of the art. His artwork was the one of a girl holding a balloon in which was sold for 1.4 million dollars. </p>
